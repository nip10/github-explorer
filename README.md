## Notes

### My approach to code challenges

- I like to have a time limit for code challenges. I try to have a good balance between getting a good result and not spending too much time on it.
- I like to explore and learn new libraries and tools. I find that this is a good oportunity to learn and improve my skills, and always take something new with me regardless of the outcome.
